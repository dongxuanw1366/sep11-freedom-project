# Entry 6
##### 06/01/24

After I created my MVP and added some of my beyond MVP, my freedom project was complete. Now I am going to present in the SEP expo.

For the SEP expo, I had to give an [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UgcGfnLjRVhjuw4PBfouf4IGefLLYo6cTXLxUhbHE-U/edit) which is a short speech that explains my project to the judges. This is because there are many projects for the judges to look through and we can't give a long presentation about it. I had to keep my speech short. My plan was just to say that my game is a clicking game where you click on the button in the middle to earn scores and buy upgrades to level up and earn more score from each click. Then I would introduce some settings of the game like how the score can go up by itself with a phaser timer function and you can press the space bar to press the button. My takeaway for the expo elevator pitch is that I need to be less nervous when presenting it and slow down when speaking. I should also talk a bit more about the code because all I did was demonstrate how to play the game and the controls, so my presentation wasn't good enough.

I also did an [in class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b_fCPDc2DB9zkZ-sAL7y2axxa58C1MdmaMroIZjcapc/edit#slide=id.g2ddbe8222d2_0_0) which is a long presentation on google slides. For this presentation I explained my project throughly and explained the challenges I faced when coding the project and the steps I took to make the project. I also explained my takeaways from this freedom project. Some takeaway from this in class presentation is that I should really slow down when presenting the project because I usually talk fast when I am nervous. I should also make more eye contact with the audience and explain my code more throughly like what each line means.

Currently, I am on step 7 and 8 of the **Engineer Design Process**. After I am done with the mvp I would get feedbacks on my beyond mvp and try to improve my project by adding more features like saving the data so you don't have to restart everytime. Now, that I am finished with the freedom project I would also communicate my result with others and talk about my project with my peers.

The skills I used for this blog was **Communication**, **Growth Mindset** and **Consideration**. I needed to communicate to others to talk about my freedom project and ask my friend about how to improve my project. A growth mindset because I need to know what I did wrong and be patient so I can sucessfully create my game and continue to develop my game to make it better. I also had to be considerate about the game I am making and how I create my presentation so that everyone can understand what my game is about. I have to explain how the game works and how the code works so people can understand the process and the product.
